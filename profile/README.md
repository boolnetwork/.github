## BoolNetwork

Bool Network is a permissionless, decentralized, and secure Bitcoin verification layer that aims, within the premise of not altering Bitcoinâ€™s consensus rules, to securely and decentralize the expansion of the Bitcoin network, thereby fostering prosperity within the Bitcoin ecosystem.
The Bitcoin Superchain project seeks to maximize interoperability and comparability between different chains using the BoolStack, and integrate siloed L2s into a single, cohesive layer.
